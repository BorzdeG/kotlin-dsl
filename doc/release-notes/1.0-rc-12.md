# Gradle Kotlin DSL 1.0 RC12 Release Notes

Gradle Kotlin DSL 1.0 RC12 brings Kotlin 1.3.0 RC2, fixes to issues identified since 1.0 RC6, API/DSL refinements and enables the script compilation build cache.

In order to benefit from the best user experience, please update IntelliJ IDEA to 2018.3 EAP, Android Studio to 3.0.2 and their Kotlin Plugin to 1.3 EAP.

Thanks to a great help from the community, the [Gradle User Manual](https://docs.gradle.org/5.0-milestone-1/userguide/userguide.html) now contains samples for both the Groovy and Kotlin DSLs. This is now the best place where to find how to do this and what with the Gradle Kotlin DSL ; and it covers all Gradle features from [using plugins](https://docs.gradle.org/5.0-milestone-1/userguide/plugins.html) to [customizing the dependency resolution behavior](https://docs.gradle.org/5.0-milestone-1/userguide/customizing_dependency_resolution_behavior.html).

A new user manual chapter dedicated to the [Gradle Kotlin DSL](https://docs.gradle.org/5.0-milestone-1/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html) has also been added.

This release contains potential breaking changes, see below.

v1.0-RC12 is included in Gradle 5.0-M1.

To use it, upgrade your Gradle wrapper in the following fashion:

    $ cd $YOUR_PROJECT_ROOT
    $ gradle wrapper --gradle-version 5.0-milestone-1 --distribution-type all

## Updates since v1.0-RC6

* **Upgrade embedded Kotlin to 1.3.0-RC2** ([#1149](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1149), [#1005](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1005), [#1112](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1112), [#1125](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1125), [#1132](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1132))
    
    Note that Gradle Kotlin DSL 1.0 will ship with Kotlin 1.3 GA.

* **Script compilation build cache is now enabled alongside the Gradle Build Cache** ([#1152](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1152))

    If you enable the [Gradle Build Cache](https://docs.gradle.org/5.0-milestone-1/userguide/build_cache.html) then the Gradle Kotlin DSL will store and fetch the outputs of script compilation, avoiding the expensive work of recompiling them.

* **Accessors for plugins present in `buildSrc`** ([#1156](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1156))

    You can now refer statically to plugins declared in `buildSrc`. Instead of:
    
    ```kotlin
    plugins {
      id("my.buildSrc.plugin.ID")
    }
    ```
    
    you can now write:
    
    ```kotlin
    plugins {
      my.buildSrc.plugin.ID
    }
    ```

* **Accessors for elements of collections** ([#879](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/879), [#1041](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1041))

    It is now possible to refer to elements of collections existing before the build script body compilation via type-safe accessors. This is applied to `configurations`, `tasks` and all Gradle extensions that are collections. For `tasks`, it means that instead of:

    ```kotlin
    plugins { java }
    tasks {
        named<Test>("test") {
            testLogging.showStacktraces = true
        }
    }
    ``` 

    you can now write:

    ```kotlin
    plugins { java }
    tasks {
        test {
            testLogging.showStacktraces = true
        }
    }
    ``` 

* **Accessors for artifact configurations in `configurations {}`** ([#1118](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1118), [#1129](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1129))

    Accessors for artifact configurations were missing in the `configurations {}` block. This has been fixed the same way as for all collections, see above. Instead of:
    
    ```kotlin
    plugins { java }
    configurations {
        named("implementation") {
            exclude(group = "org.foo")
        }
    }
    ```

    you can now write:

    ```kotlin
    plugins { java }
    configurations {
        implementation {
            exclude(group = "org.foo")
        }
    }
    ```

* **Refine dependency constraints DSL** ([#710](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/710), [#1091](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1091))

    Accessors for artifact configurations were missing in the `dependencies { constraints {} }` block. This has been fixed. Instead of:

    ```kotlin
    plugins { java }
    dependencies {
        constraints {
            add("implementation", "com.google.collections:google-collections") {
                version { rejectAll() }
                because("Google collections is superceded by Guava")
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    you can now write:

    ```kotlin
    plugins { java }
    dependencies {
        constraints {
            implementation("com.google.collections:google-collections") {
                version { rejectAll() }
                because("Google collections is superceded by Guava")
            }
        }
    }
    ```

* **Refine containers API** ([#1042](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1042), [#1104](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1104), [#1108](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1108), [#1116](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1116))

    During the RC phase, several discrepancies were found in the domain object collections and containers API. Special care has been taken to iron it in this release.

* **Let the `kotlin-dsl` plugin configure precompiled script plugins support** ([#1135](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1135))

    Applying the `kotlin-dsl` plugin now also applies the `kotlin-dsl-precompiled-script-plugins` plugin. See the [Gradle Kotlin DSL Primer](https://docs.gradle.org/5.0-milestone-1/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html) chapter of the Gradle User Manual for more information. 

* **Refine IDE script dependencies resolver** ([#1133](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1133), [#1124](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1124), [#1139](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1139))

    The dependencies resolver backing IDE editors for `.gradle.kts` scripts has been refined to emit warnings only when necessary and display actionable messages.

For the complete list see the `gradle/kotlin-dsl` issues for [1.0-RC12](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=milestone%3A1.0-RC12+is%3Aclosed+).

## Breaking changes

This release contains some potential breaking changes:

* **Upgrade embedded Kotlin to 1.3.0-RC2**

    TODO

* **Artifact configuration accessors are now typed `NamedDomainObjectProvider<Configuration>`**

    Instead of simply `Configuration`. This goes in line with the fact that the Kotlin DSL sugar embrace the new configuration avoidance APIs. 

## Avoiding Gradle Kotlin DSL internal APIs

Use of Kotlin DSL internal APIs in plugins and build scripts has the potential to break builds when either Gradle or plugins change.

The Kotlin DSL extends the [Gradle public API definition](https://docs.gradle.org/5.0-milestone-1/userguide/authoring_maintainable_build_scripts.html#sec:avoiding_gradle_internal_apis) with `org/gradle/kotlin/dsl/*` excluding any subpackages.
