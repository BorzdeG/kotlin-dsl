## Avoiding Gradle Kotlin DSL internal APIs

Use of Kotlin DSL internal APIs in plugins and build scripts has the potential to break builds when either Gradle or plugins change.

The Kotlin DSL extends the [Gradle public API definition](https://docs.gradle.org/5.0-milestone-1/userguide/authoring_maintainable_build_scripts.html#sec:avoiding_gradle_internal_apis) with `org/gradle/kotlin/dsl/*` excluding any subpackages.
